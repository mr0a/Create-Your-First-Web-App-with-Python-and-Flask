# Create-Your-First-Web-App-with-Python-and-Flask

## Video 1: Introduction
This is the introduction to the app we are going to make and the rhyme platform
- In this project we will be building a todo app where we will be able to add, edit or delete tasks using flask, python and SQLalchemy.

## Video 2: A Minimal App
The starter files are in the templates/starter folder.
* We will create a file app.py which is the entry point to our app
* Do you know about `__name__` in python?  
** If you run the file directly python will assign `__name__ = main`
